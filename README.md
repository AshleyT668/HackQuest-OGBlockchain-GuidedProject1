# HackQuest-OG Blockchain-Guided Project 1

This project was completed as part of the HackQuest OG Track, where I learned how to deploy a meme coin on the OG Blockchain. The project walks through the entire process of writing, deploying, and verifying a simple token contract.

ðŸ“– Project Overview

The goal of this guided project is to:

-Understand the fundamentals of token contracts on the OG chain.

-Write and deploy a meme coin smart contract.

-Verify deployment on the OG blockchain using ChainScan.
